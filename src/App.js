   <h3>About Me :</h3>
   <p>Iâ€™m studying development and I do enjoy it, most aspects of it.<br/> But in this last month there is a lot of hard work and a lot of reading, and I cannot say that I enjoy all of this reading.<br/> But what I really enjoy is working on workshop studies. What I mean is discussing cases and examples.<br/> I like to exchange ideas with people.</p>
